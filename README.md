Simulation code for Hybrid T One and Magnetization transfer (HYTOM) method.  These simulations are built upon the EPG-X framework developed by Shaihan Malik, Kingâ€™s College London. <a href="https://github.com/shaihanmalik">GitHub</a>

Feel free to reach me at <a href="mailto:duanchong520@gmail.com">duanchong520@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions or want to contribute to these simulation code.s

## Requirements
<li>Matlab R2017a (earlier version may also work, not tested yet)</li>
<li>Parallel Computing Toolbox</li>

## Example test calculations
### test_figure_2a_2b
2a: Simulate the bSSFP signal evolution for three scenarios: 1) single pool; 2) two pools; 3) two pools with magnetization transfer preparation.

2b: Plot the off-resonance profiles for each of the scenarios at the center of kspace (you may choose any echoes).

### test_figure_2c
2c: Simulate the inversion recovery curve for MOLLI and HYTOM, and fit the simulated signal to a 3-parameter model
